# Problems the Course Hub Tackles
[.text: line-height(.8]
- Pedagogical goals that are unmet by the current LMS
- Student and facilitator experiences, especially multi-device, are below expectations
- Ability to access, share and collaboratively edit course materials is lacking
- The creation and (often frequently needed) updating of online course materials is too time consuming
- Once created, online course materials are difficult to repurpose on different platforms for different contexts
- Unable to leverage existing Web authoring skills or standards on the current Learning Platform

# :speech_balloon: What are Users Saying? :speech_balloon:

---

> “The Open Course Hub was easy to set up and get running and my students loved having a one-stop place to go to for their course content. I really love that it syncs with GitHub so easily and seamlessly. I was able to have an open, collaborative, easily updatable, fully version-controlled site up and running in little time, with fairly modest technical skills. On the student side, it is all beautiful and easy to use on any device!”
-- Mark Coster (Associate Professor at Griffith University, Australia)

---

> “The Open Course Hub project provides a series of excellent resources for integrating Grav with Canvas, as well as documentation and examples which make them a joy to work with. It is quick to set up, easy to use, and especially with the Git Sync plugin shows the power of a modern approach to integrated CMS-LMS solutions. The large and complex architecture of Canvas is complemented by the relative simplicity of Grav, and the Open Course Hub demonstrates this well.”
-- Ole Vik (Research Assistant at the University of Bergen, Norway and Grav Plugin Developer)
