# Problems That Course Hub Addresses
- Pedagogical goals that are unmet by the current LMS
- Student and facilitator experiences, especially multi-device, are below expectations
- Ability to access, share and collaboratively edit course materials is lacking
- The creation and (often frequently needed) updating of online course materials is too time consuming
- Once created, online course materials are difficult to repurpose on different platforms for different contexts
- Unable to leverage existing Web authoring skills or standards on the current Learning Platform
